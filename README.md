# Term Deposit Prediction Using Deep Learning

This project aims to predict term deposits using Deep Learning. The model is built using the TensorFlow library in Python.

## Project Structure

The project mainly consists of a Python script that imports the necessary libraries, loads the data, preprocesses it, creates a model, trains the model, and finally evaluates it.

## Libraries Used

- pandas
- tensorflow
- ydata_profiling
- sklearn

## How to Run

1. Ensure that all the necessary libraries mentioned in `requirements.txt` are installed.
2. Run the Python script to train and evaluate the model.
